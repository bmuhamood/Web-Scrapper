For windows you can go to [Ruby installer](https://rubyinstaller.org/) and for MAC and LINUX you can go to [Ruby official site](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/) for intructions on how to intall it. Then you can clone the project by typing `https://github.com/bmuhamood/Web-Scrapper.git`, The scrapping page `https://katcr.to/usearch/` will and display the number of pages.

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

- Go to the main page of the repo.
- Press the "Code" button and get the repo link.
- Clone it using git.

## Running tests with Rspec

The methods were tested with Rspec which is a computer domain-specific language (DSL) testing tool written in programming language Ruby to test Ruby code. It is a behavior-driven development (BDD) framework which is extensively used in production applications.

## How to install Rspec

- In the terminal, type `gem install rspec`
- Once done, go to project directory and type `rspec --init`
- You will see a folder `spec` and a file `.rspec`
- Inside spec folder you'll see a `spec_helper.rb` file.

## How to run Rspec

- In the terminal from the project repository, type `rspec` and all test Units will be displayed as per the below image

## How to Install required Bundle and get the scrapping tool running

From the project repository.

- In the Terminal, Run `bundle install`
- Then cd `bin`
- Run `ruby main.rb`
- Place `Enter` two times for the program to run
- Please ignore the `[DEPRECIATION]`warning related to HTTParty observed in the terminal while running the program. The `object, # nil` makes more sense when nothing is found.
